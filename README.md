This is where I started my Portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building.

## **Project Topic: Data Analysis** 

### **Project Overview**

This Data Analysis project exposed me to Microsoft Excel and learned more than forty (40) functions, including how to clean and summarize data, create pivot tables, and a lot more. I was also taught Structured Query Language (SQL), where databases, tables, and views were created. I learnt how to import files, work with SQL commands, datatypes, keys, and logical operators, among others. I was also taught several things about Power BI
